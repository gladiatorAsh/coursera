Non-Personalized Recommenders

Aims:

Value
Drawbacks
Aggregated Opinion Recommenders
Basic Product Ass Recommenders
Examples



Story of Zagat- Restaurant recos
Readers submit recos abt sevice, decor, food, cost
Secret formula- Mean of all ratings *10

Story of Conde Nast Travellers- Cruise recos
Tallies the Percentage of people who rate a cruise as good or excellent 

Similar Trip advisor ,BillBoard are all non-personalized  recommendations

Averages can be misleading. They can occur for discrepancies in the first but not in the second.

Averages are useful when you have a large num of rtings to control outliers

Averages lack Context hence non personalied product recos

People who are X are also Y
First reate dataset
User pROFILES not good for ketchups
Transaction data not good for follow up orders
User Profiles but time constrained


Computing Profiles 

%= (X and Y)/Y but tis suffers from banana trap

Issue occurs when Y is very popular


Another formula- 

% =(X and Y)/X divided by (!X and Y)/!X

Formula focusses on Increase in Y associated with X

Lift metric: P(X AND Y)/(P(X)*P(Y))


Zagat guide keeps getting worse

mediocre restaurants with good scores and excellent restaurants with mediocre restaurants

Why?

Self Selection bias
Increased diversity of users

Non -personalized averages can be effective in right application

Product associations need context

Still face challenges in a clustered diverese env



Preferences and Ratings

To recommend you need data like what users like, what goes together.

Aim: How data is collected , types of data can be collected , what data is being used to provide recos
