What is movielens?
Ans 
Movielens is a recommender system which works well in predicting what movies we may want to watch.

It does this by asking us to assign three points from a list of categories of movies. This enables it to achieve high quality initial personalization by knowing our preferences towards entire categories of movies instead of individual movies thus saving time and frustration. (See http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2675133.2675210&preflayout=flat).

Another customization that we can do is choose from different algorithms used for generating recommendations namely the non-personalized(PEASANT), movie group point allocation (The BARD), item-item collabrative filtering by finding similarities and differences among all movies in the system based on user ratings(Warrior),singular value decomposition algorithm to capture essential preference aspects of a movie or a user and turning all user's ratings data into a small set of factors(Wizard)

Another customization is using IP address to find country of origina dn recommending Bollywood movies (movies particular to that region and language)
